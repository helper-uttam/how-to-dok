# How To DOK Contributors

These are the wonderful people who have donated their time and effort to help make DoK better for all of us. We wouldn't be where we are today without your contributions. Thank you! ðŸ™Œ

[New contributors](CONTRIBUTING.md) should add their name to the bottom of this list on their first pull request. If you are a contributor in other ways other than code, please either submit a pull request adding your name, or mention it to another maintainer and we will add you. **All** contributors belong here - please don't hesitate do add yourself even if you have contributed to documentation, or in any other way!
